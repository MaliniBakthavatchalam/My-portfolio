                        Pizza Runner
I really learnt a lot working on this Danny Ma's case study
link to the case is here https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/case-study-2/

Data cleaning the two tables 
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS temprunorders;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE temprunorders (
SELECT 
   order_id,
   	runner_id,
   	CASE 
   	WHEN pickup_time LIKE '%null%' THEN ' ' 
       ELSE pickup_time
   END AS pickup_time,
   	CASE
     WHEN distance LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
     WHEN distance LIKE '%km%' THEN TRIM('km' from distance)
     ELSE distance 
   	END AS distance,
 	CASE
     WHEN duration LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
     WHEN duration LIKE '%mins%' THEN TRIM('mins' from duration)
     WHEN duration LIKE '%minute%' THEN TRIM('minute' from duration)
     WHEN duration LIKE '%minutes%' THEN TRIM('minutes' from duration)
     ELSE duration
   END AS duration,
 	CASE
     WHEN cancellation IS NULL or cancellation LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
     ELSE cancellation
   END AS cancellation
FROM runner_orders);

ALTER TABLE temprunorders
MODIFY COLUMN pickup_time DATETIME,
MODIFY COLUMN distance FLOAT,
MODIFY COLUMN duration INT;

-- Customer orders temporary table
DROP TEMPORARY TABLE IF EXISTS tempcustorders;
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE tempcustorders (
SELECT
   order_id,
   customer_id,
   pizza_id,
   CASE
   WHEN exclusions LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
   ELSE exclusions
   END AS exclusions,
   CASE
   WHEN extras LIKE '%null%' THEN ' '
       WHEN extras is null THEN ' '
   ELSE extras
   END AS extras,
   order_time
FROM customer_orders);


I did like to work on the all the questions, but the first pizza metrics I took as an example and worked out problems whereas the rest I will try to post it here
